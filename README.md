So I just had an idea and this is the culmanation of about an hour of scrolling instagram reels and forgetting how github works and eating a subway footlong tuna sandwitch
The way this works, is it tests the correlation of each numerical variable to the goal variable
Then it makes a linear regression model for each variable
It then multiplies the output of each model by its correlation to the variable
After that it sums all the weighted models and divides them by the sum of all the correlations.
